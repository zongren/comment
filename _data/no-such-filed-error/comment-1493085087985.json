I had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you do not mind.\r\nI was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your head prior to writing.\r\nI've had a difficult time clearing my mind in getting my ideas out \r\nthere. I truly do take pleasure in writing but it just seems like the first \r\n10 to 15 minutes are wasted just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or hints?\r\nAppreciate it!","path":"2016/10/21/no-such-filed-error/","date":"2017-04-25T01:51:27.985Z"}
