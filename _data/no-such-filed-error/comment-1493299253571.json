I had a quick question that I'd \r\nlike to ask if you do not mind. I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear \r\nyour thoughts prior to writing. I've had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out there.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 \r\nto 15 minutes are usually lost just trying to figure out how to \r\nbegin. Any recommendations or hints? Kudos!","path":"2016/10/21/no-such-filed-error/","date":"2017-04-27T13:20:53.570Z"}
